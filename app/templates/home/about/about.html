    <h2>About</h2> <br>
    <p>The Red Boar Inn is a project in development that mixes RPG, MMO and the SIMPLICITY of running in any browser.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p> -> For this project I want the player to be able to interact and leave their mark on the game's history</p>
    <p> -> The main idea is to allow you to create different types of gameplay choices and follow along.
        This type of game is my personal choice, about what I would like to play, but it is not limited to that,
        as the community grows I will accept suggestions for implementations.</p>

    <p> <strong>"The freedom to participate in arena events, explore the world, create unique items to use or sell,
            help other players fight a common enemy, or stop for a while at the tavern and have a drink with the
            bard."</strong></p>
